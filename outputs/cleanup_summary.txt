PROJECT CLEANUP SUMMARY
=======================

REMOVED FILES:
- __pycache__/ (Python cache directory)
- config_clean.py (duplicate configuration file)
- DataAnalysis.py (old basic analysis script)
- Predict.py (old basic prediction script)
- DataAnalysis_Output_Figure.png (old output figure)
- demo.py (requires dependencies, replaced by unified entry point)
- generate_report.py (temporary report generator)

CLEANED UP FILES:
- simple_demo.py (removed redundant explanatory text)
- requirements.txt (streamlined dependencies)
- README.md (made more concise and focused)

CREATED FILES:
- run.py (unified entry point that handles both scenarios)

FINAL PROJECT STRUCTURE:
├── run.py                     # Unified entry point (RECOMMENDED)
├── main.py                    # Advanced system (requires dependencies)
├── minimal_ml.py             # Minimal system (no dependencies)
├── simple_demo.py            # Simple demonstration
├── config.py                 # Configuration management
├── advanced_analysis.py      # Advanced data analysis
├── feature_engineering.py    # Feature engineering pipeline
├── advanced_ml.py           # Machine learning pipeline
├── predictor.py             # Model deployment service
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── README.md               # Project documentation
├── StudentPerformance.csv   # Dataset
├── outputs/                 # Generated reports
├── figures/                 # Visualization outputs
└── models/                  # Trained model files

BENEFITS OF CLEANUP:
1. Removed duplicate and obsolete files
2. Streamlined project structure
3. Created unified entry point for easy execution
4. Simplified documentation
5. Reduced dependencies confusion
6. Improved maintainability

USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `python run.py` for automatic system detection
- Use `python minimal_ml.py` for dependency-free execution
- Use `python simple_demo.py` for quick demonstration
- Use `python main.py` only when all dependencies are installed

The project is now cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to use!
